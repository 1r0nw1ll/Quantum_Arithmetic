# Quantum Arithmetic

Welcome to the official repository for Quantum Arithmetic (QA) â€” an integer-based, harmonic, and modular replacement for classical calculus and floating-point systems. This repository hosts the foundational documents, proofs, models, and applied simulations originally developed by Ben Iverson and expanded by Dale Pond.

## ðŸ“š What is Quantum Arithmetic?

Quantum Arithmetic is a symbolic number system based on integer 4-tuples `(b, e, d, a)` that defines harmonic and geometric relationships using modular arithmetic, rather than floating-point or calculus-based approximations.

It:
- Eliminates irrational and floating-point errors
- Models natural systems using harmonic, resonant structures
- Supports cryptography, prime prediction, modular cycles, and acoustic physics

## ðŸ”§ What You'll Find Here

- **Core Theory**:
  - `Quantum Arithmetic and Toroidal Circulations.odt`
  - `Quantum Arithmetic as a Replacement for Calculus and Floating-Point Systems.odt`

- **Acoustic Modeling**:
  - `qa_accoustic_collab_v2.odt` â€” Dome resonance via QA ellipses and mod-24 standing waves

- **New Discoveries**:
  - `harmonic_mirror_plane.txt` â€” Redefines the complex plane as a harmonic reflection framework

## ðŸ§  Who Is This For?

Researchers, mathematicians, physicists, cryptographers, and anyone interested in natural number-based mathematics, symbolic computing, harmonic geometry, or post-quantum systems.

## ðŸ“¡ Coming Soon

- Interactive simulations
- QA-based cryptography tools
